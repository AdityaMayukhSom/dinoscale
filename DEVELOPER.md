### Notes:

1. Although `C++` supports `public` and `private` methods, but the methods are declared inside `.hpp` files but defined inside `.cpp` files. Thus for convinience, methods inside a class that are public must use `PascalCase` in naming whereas methods that are private must use `camelCase` (This convention is borrowed from `Go` programming language).
