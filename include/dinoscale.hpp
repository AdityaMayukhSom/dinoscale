/**
This file will expose all the API's of DinoScale through a single import.

Need to consider the size factor if the project grows too large, in that case
exporting all the functionalities may not be a good option, then this module
needs to be broken into simpler chunks so that the user can import only the
neseccary portion of the code.

If the project grows too large, i.e. the file size of single .hpp files become
huge, we may want to split the .hpp into header files for declaration and .cpp
files for implementation. In that case distributing only object files would be
enough for linking.
